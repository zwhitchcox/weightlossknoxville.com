Taking the first step toward medical weight loss can feel both exciting and a little nerve-wracking. You might be wondering what actually happens during an initial consultation, whether you will qualify for medication, and how long the whole process takes.

At Weight Loss Knox in Knoxville, TN, we have designed our consultation process to be thorough but also straightforward and comfortable. We want you to leave your first visit feeling informed, confident, and ready to start your weight loss journey. Here is a complete walkthrough of what to expect.

## Before Your Appointment: What to Bring

A little preparation goes a long way. To make your first visit as efficient as possible, please bring the following:

- **Photo ID and insurance card** (if applicable)
- **A list of current medications**, including dosages and any supplements you take
- **Recent lab work**, if you have had any within the past 3–6 months (we can also order labs if needed)
- **A summary of your medical history**, including any prior surgeries, chronic conditions, and family health history
- **Previous weight loss history** — this includes any diets, programs, or medications you have tried in the past
- **Questions you want to ask** — write them down so you do not forget

You do not need to have all of this perfectly organized. Our team will walk through everything with you and fill in any gaps during the consultation.

## Step 1: Initial Intake and Health History Review

Your visit begins with a detailed health history intake. A member of our medical team will sit down with you to discuss:

- **Your weight history**: When did weight become a concern? Have you experienced weight fluctuations? What have you tried before?
- **Medical conditions**: Diabetes, high blood pressure, sleep apnea, thyroid issues, PCOS, joint problems, and other conditions that may affect or be affected by your weight.
- **Medications**: Certain medications can contribute to weight gain, and it is important for us to understand the full picture before recommending treatment.
- **Lifestyle factors**: Your typical eating patterns, physical activity level, sleep quality, stress levels, and any emotional or behavioral factors related to food.
- **Goals and expectations**: What does success look like for you? We want to understand not just a number on the scale but how you want to feel and what you want to be able to do.

This conversation is a two-way street. We are not here to judge your past efforts — we are here to understand where you are now and build a plan that actually works for your life.

## Step 2: Physical Assessment and Measurements

After the history review, we conduct a physical assessment that typically includes:

- **Height, weight, and BMI calculation**
- **Blood pressure measurement**
- **Waist circumference** and other relevant body measurements
- **Body composition analysis**, when indicated, to understand your ratio of lean mass to fat mass
- **General physical assessment** to identify any visible health concerns

These baseline measurements give us concrete starting points and help us track your progress over time. They also help determine which treatments are medically appropriate for you.

## Step 3: Laboratory Testing

Depending on whether you have recent lab work available, we may order blood tests to get a complete picture of your metabolic health. Common labs include:

- **Complete metabolic panel** (kidney function, liver function, blood sugar)
- **Lipid panel** (cholesterol and triglycerides)
- **Hemoglobin A1c** (3-month average blood sugar — important for diabetes screening)
- **Thyroid function tests** (TSH, and additional thyroid markers if indicated)
- **Vitamin and nutrient levels** when relevant (such as vitamin D or B12)

Lab results help us identify underlying conditions that may be contributing to weight gain or that need to be considered in your treatment plan. For example, undiagnosed insulin resistance or hypothyroidism can make weight loss significantly harder without proper treatment.

If labs are ordered during your visit, results are typically available within a few days, and we will review them with you at your follow-up or over a phone call.

## Step 4: Treatment Plan Discussion

This is the core of your consultation — the part where we put it all together. Based on your health history, physical assessment, lab results (if available), and personal goals, our provider will discuss:

### Medication Options

If you are a candidate for weight loss medication, we will explain the options available to you — including tirzepatide, semaglutide, and other medications when appropriate. We cover:

- How each medication works
- Expected results based on clinical data
- Potential side effects and how we manage them
- Dosing schedules and how titration works
- Cost, insurance coverage, and available savings programs

### Lifestyle Recommendations

Medication is most effective when combined with sustainable lifestyle changes. We will discuss:

- **Nutrition guidance** tailored to your medication and goals (not a restrictive crash diet)
- **Physical activity** recommendations appropriate for your current fitness level
- **Hydration and sleep** — two often-overlooked factors in weight management
- **Behavioral strategies** for managing cravings, emotional eating, and building new habits

### Follow-Up Schedule

We will outline a follow-up plan so you know exactly what comes next. Most patients see us:

- **Monthly** during the initial titration phase (first 3–4 months)
- **Every 4–8 weeks** once a stable maintenance dose is reached
- **As needed** for any questions or concerns between visits

Regular follow-ups are essential. They allow us to adjust your medication dosing, monitor for side effects, track your progress, and provide ongoing support and accountability.

## Step 5: Starting Treatment

If you and your provider decide to move forward with medication, treatment can often begin the same day or within a few days depending on lab results and insurance processing. We will:

- Provide your first injection or prescription
- Walk you through exactly how to administer the medication at home
- Give you written instructions and resources
- Make sure you know how to reach us with any questions

For patients who are not ready to start medication or who may benefit from a lifestyle-first approach, we develop a plan focused on nutrition, activity, and behavior change with the option to add medication later.

## What Your First Visit Is Not

We find it helpful to set expectations about what the consultation is **not**:

- **It is not a sales pitch.** We will give you honest, evidence-based information and let you make the best decision for yourself.
- **It is not a judgment session.** Everyone's weight journey is different, and there is no shame in seeking help.
- **It is not a one-size-fits-all plan.** Your treatment is personalized to you.
- **It is not a one-and-done visit.** This is the beginning of an ongoing relationship with your medical weight loss team.

## How Long Does the Consultation Take?

Plan for your first visit to take approximately **45 minutes to one hour**. This allows enough time for a thorough evaluation without feeling rushed. We believe this initial investment of time leads to better outcomes because we truly understand your situation before recommending treatment.
