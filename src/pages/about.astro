            with physician-supervised weight loss programs that are safe, effective, and sustainable. We believe

          <h3 class="font-serif text-xl font-semibold text-primary">Comprehensive Medical Evaluation</h3>
          <p class="mt-3 leading-relaxed text-neutral-600">
            Your journey begins with a thorough medical assessment, including a review of your health history,
            current medications, lab work, and body composition analysis. This allows our physicians to understand
            the metabolic, hormonal, and lifestyle factors contributing to your weight, ensuring we choose the
            most effective treatment path.

          <p class="mt-3 leading-relaxed text-neutral-600">
            Based on your evaluation, our physicians may prescribe tirzepatide or semaglutide, two of the most
            effective weight loss medications available today. These GLP-1 receptor agonists work by regulating
            appetite, improving insulin sensitivity, and supporting metabolic function. All medications are
            prescribed and monitored directly by our medical team.

            Medication alone is not enough for lasting change. Our team provides personalized nutrition counseling,

  <!-- Why Medical Weight Loss -->

    <div class="mx-auto max-w-4xl">
      <h2 class="text-center font-serif text-3xl font-bold text-primary">Why Medical Weight Loss?</h2>

        <div class="rounded-xl bg-neutral-50 p-6">
          <h3 class="font-serif text-lg font-semibold text-primary">The Science of Obesity</h3>
          <p class="mt-2 text-sm leading-relaxed text-neutral-600">
            Research has shown that obesity involves complex hormonal and metabolic pathways. Hormones like
            GLP-1 and GIP play key roles in appetite regulation, glucose metabolism, and fat storage.
            Medications like tirzepatide and semaglutide work with these pathways rather than against them,
            making weight loss more achievable and sustainable.

        </div>
        <div class="rounded-xl bg-neutral-50 p-6">
          <h3 class="font-serif text-lg font-semibold text-primary">Beyond Dieting</h3>
          <p class="mt-2 text-sm leading-relaxed text-neutral-600">
            Studies consistently show that diet and exercise alone lead to long-term weight regain for
            the majority of people. This is not a failure of willpower but rather the result of metabolic
            adaptation. Medical weight loss addresses these biological barriers, giving patients the
            physiological support they need to lose weight and keep it off.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="rounded-xl bg-neutral-50 p-6">
          <h3 class="font-serif text-lg font-semibold text-primary">Health Benefits Beyond the Scale</h3>
          <p class="mt-2 text-sm leading-relaxed text-neutral-600">
            Medical weight loss is associated with improvements in blood pressure, blood sugar control,
            cholesterol levels, sleep quality, joint pain, and overall cardiovascular risk. Many of our
            patients report transformative improvements in energy and daily function well before reaching
            their goal weight.

        <div class="rounded-xl bg-neutral-50 p-6">
          <h3 class="font-serif text-lg font-semibold text-primary">Safety and Accountability</h3>
          <p class="mt-2 text-sm leading-relaxed text-neutral-600">
            With physician supervision, your weight loss is monitored for safety at every stage. Lab work,
            vitals, and symptoms are tracked regularly. If side effects occur, your physician can adjust
            your treatment plan promptly, ensuring you lose weight in a way that supports rather than
            compromises your health.
